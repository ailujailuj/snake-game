This project is a part of my learning path as a frontend developer. It was developed during the Frontend course offered by <a href="https://scrimba.com/">Scrimba</a>.

It's a vanilla Javascript grid-based game. JS logic was teached by Ania Kubow and the code was written during the course. Style was written mostly by me.
